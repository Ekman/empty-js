# Empty PHP

The purpose of this library is to be a zero dependency and exact replica of the [PHP empty function](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.empty.php). The library is compatible with evergreen browsers, IE 11 and all Node LTS.

* "" (an empty string)
* 0 (0 as an integer)
* 0.0 (0 as a float)
* "0" (0 as a string)
* NULL
* FALSE
* array() (an empty array)

}
```
